## What is Git?
Git is a **Version control** software. It maintains different versions of out code/project as well as history of our changes.

## What is a commit?
In git a commit is a checkpoint of the changes we made in our project. We can review all previous commits and revert back to any point in time we may want to. It's important to put clear commit messages, so you know what changes had occured there.

## What is a branch?
A branch a different version of our code that comes from a certain commit. Changes that occur on a seperate branch don't effect the main or any other branches. They're independant until they are merged into other branches.
